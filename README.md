# EventBus

EventBus is a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use publish/subscribe event bus system implemented in Go. It allows components within an application to communicate with each other using events without knowing the details of who is handling these events.

## Installation

To use EventBus in your Go projects, simply install it using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/ozgen/eventbus@v0.1.0
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the EventBus:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/ozgen/eventbus"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    bus := eventbus.New()

    bus.Subscribe("myEvent", func(e eventbus.Event) {
        fmt.Printf("Event Received: %v\n", e.Payload)
    })

    bus.Publish(eventbus.Event{Type: "myEvent", Payload: "Hello, World!"})
}
```

This will output:

```
Event Received: Hello, World!
```
